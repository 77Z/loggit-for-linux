# How to run unbuilt versions
### things you WILL need:
    - Node.js
    - Git

Once you have installed those, type in your command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/77Z/loggit-editor
cd loggit-editor
npm start
```

from there, the editor will start.

# Settings.json

there is a settings.json file. It allows you to customize the editor by changing a few values.

it is located in the ``loggit-editor`` folder under ``config/settings.json``

The next section will show you how to apply those things to the editor itself.

# Applying settings

To apply settings, there are two keybinds. Why two? because they both do different things depending on what settings you change.

The keybinds are ``Ctrl+R`` to reload the main window, and ``Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R`` to restart the program

``Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R`` is subject to change.
